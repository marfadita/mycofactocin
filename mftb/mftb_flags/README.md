We decided to check how Flags works with existing clusters, as an alternative to the pipeline with mmseqs2 and rodeo

env == eFlaGs2
The cases of the absence of MftA are not considered separately, since the reading frames of precursor peptides are often mistakenly not annotated, because they are short. With a detailed analysis of the obtained frames, we see that MftCs are often not annotated because they fall on the edge of the contigue
