## Introduction 
Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) pathways produce a diverse array of natural products. A subset of these pathways depends on radical S-adenosylmethionine proteins to modify the RiPP-produced peptide. Mycofactocin biosynthesis is one example of an S-adenosylmethionine protein-dependent RiPP pathway.
Mycofactocin has been proposed to be a new member of the peptide-derived redox cofactor family that consists of members such as pyrroloquinoline quinone. The mycofactocin biosynthetic pathway is composed of six genes, mftABCDEF, beginning with the peptide MftA. MftA is 30 â€“ 60 AA in length and contains a conserved C-terminal sequence (-IDGXCGVY).
## Aim
The aim is to find unusual functional mycofactocin-like clusters by analyzing the data and prepare the data for further gene research.
## Workflow
* Data preparation
  * PSI-BLAST with known MftB(RRE protein) sequence as query
  * Manual deletion of false positive results
  * mmseqs2 clusterisation
* Identify biosynthetic gene clusters
  * RODEO
  * Flags2 analysis
  * Calculating the frequency of pairwise occurrence of domains in clusters
  * MEME analysis of conserved positions in precursor (MftA)
* Results visualization
  * Cytoscape
  * RAxML tree

## Results

* Cytoscape
The network is built by issuing EFI EST by fasta of the MftB file. Firstly, found the node closest to the original sequence in which the search began

## Conclusions
According to the data obtained, mycofactocin clusters have a small variety.All the occurring diversity of the mft cluster is described in the literature. Mycofactocin is a cofactor, so there is no such selection in favor of diversity as in antibiotics
